# üå¥ VACATION TRACKING SYSTEM (VTS) ‚Äî Vision & Requirements

## üß† Vision
VTS aims to increase employee independence by improving internal business processes.  
It provides a solution to manage employment agreements and leave requests ‚Äî reducing time and cost.

---

## üë• Actors
- **Workers**
- **Managers**
- **Clerks**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements
- Implements a flexible, rules-based system for validating and verifying leave-time requests.  
- Enables manager approval (optional).  
- Provides access to requests for the previous calendar year and allows requests up to 18 months in the future.  
- Uses email notifications to request manager approval and notify employees of request status changes.  
- Uses existing hardware and middleware.  
- Is implemented as an extension to the existing intranet portal system and uses the portal‚Äôs single sign-on mechanisms for authentication.  
- Keeps activity logs for all transactions.  
- Enables HR and system administration personnel to override restricted actions (with logging).  
- Allows managers to directly award personal leave time (within system-set limits).  
- Provides a web service interface for querying employee vacation summaries.  
- Interfaces with HR legacy systems to retrieve employee information and updates.

---

## üß≠ Non-Functional Requirements
- The system must be **easy to use**.

## üéØ Use Case ‚Äî Manage Time

**Use case name:** Manage Time  
**Actor:** Employee  
**Goal:** Submit a new vacation time request.  
**Preconditions:** The employee is authenticated via the portal and has privileges to manage vacation time.

### ü™ú Main Flow
1. The employee opens the VTS link from the intranet portal.  
2. VTS retrieves the employee‚Äôs current vacation requests and balances (past 6 months and up to 18 months ahead).  
3. The employee selects a vacation category with a positive balance.  
4. VTS prompts for vacation dates and hours (with a visual calendar).  
5. The employee enters the desired dates, hours, title, and description, then submits.  
6. If data is incomplete or invalid, the form is redisplayed with errors highlighted.  
7. The employee can modify or cancel the request.  
8. If valid, VTS confirms submission and, if required, sends an approval email to the manager.  
9. The request status becomes **Pending Approval**.  
10. The manager accesses the approval link or logs into the VTS.  
11. The manager authenticates (if required).  
12. VTS shows the manager‚Äôs own requests and those pending from subordinates.  
13. The manager reviews each request and approves or rejects it (with reason if rejected).  
14. The system notifies the employee by email and updates the request status.
